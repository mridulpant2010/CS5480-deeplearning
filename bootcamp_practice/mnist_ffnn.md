Certainly! Let's break down the mathematics behind the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) code for the MNIST dataset step by step. We will cover the key mathematical concepts involved in each part of the code, including the forward pass, loss computation, and backpropagation.

### 1. **Model Architecture**

The MLP consists of three layers:
- **Input Layer**: Takes in the flattened 28x28 pixel images (784 input features).
- **Hidden Layer 1**: 128 neurons.
- **Hidden Layer 2**: 64 neurons.
- **Output Layer**: 10 neurons (one for each digit from 0 to 9).

#### Mathematical Representation

1. **Input Layer to Hidden Layer 1**:
   - Let $$ \mathbf{x} $$ be the input vector of size $$ 784 $$.
   - Let $$ \mathbf{W}_1 $$ be the weight matrix of size $$ 128 \times 784 $$ and $$ \mathbf{b}_1 $$ be the bias vector of size $$ 128 $$.
   - The output of Hidden Layer 1 can be calculated as:
     $$
     \mathbf{z}_1 = \mathbf{W}_1 \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}_1
     $$
   - Apply the activation function (ReLU):
     $$
     \mathbf{a}_1 = \text{ReLU}(\mathbf{z}_1) = \max(0, \mathbf{z}_1)
     $$

2. **Hidden Layer 1 to Hidden Layer 2**:
   - Let $$ \mathbf{W}_2 $$ be the weight matrix of size $$ 64 \times 128 $$ and $$ \mathbf{b}_2 $$ be the bias vector of size $$ 64 $$.
   - The output of Hidden Layer 2 can be calculated as:
     $$
     \mathbf{z}_2 = \mathbf{W}_2 \mathbf{a}_1 + \mathbf{b}_2
     $$
   - Apply the activation function (ReLU):
     $$
     \mathbf{a}_2 = \text{ReLU}(\mathbf{z}_2) = \max(0, \mathbf{z}_2)
     $$

3. **Hidden Layer 2 to Output Layer**:
   - Let $$ \mathbf{W}_3 $$ be the weight matrix of size $$ 10 \times 64 $$ and $$ \mathbf{b}_3 $$ be the bias vector of size $$ 10 $$.
   - The output logits can be calculated as:
     $$
     \mathbf{z}_3 = \mathbf{W}_3 \mathbf{a}_2 + \mathbf{b}_3
     $$
   - The final output (logits) is $$ z_3$$, which will be passed to the softmax function for classification.

### 2. **Loss Computation**

The loss function used is Cross Entropy Loss, which is commonly used for multi-class classification problems.

#### Mathematical Representation

Given the true labels $$ y_i$$ (one-hot encoded for multi-class classification) and predicted probabilities from softmax $$ p_i$$:

- The softmax function converts logits to probabilities:
$$
p_j = \frac{\exp(z_j)}{\sum_{k=0}^{C-1} e^{z_k}} 
$$
where $$ C = 10$$ (number of classes).

- The Cross Entropy Loss is defined as:
$$
L = -\sum_{i=0}^{C-1} y_i \log(p_i)
$$
This loss measures how well the predicted probabilities match the true labels.

### 3. **Backpropagation**

Backpropagation is used to compute gradients for updating weights during training.

#### Steps in Backpropagation

1. **Compute Gradients for Output Layer**:
   - For each output neuron, compute the gradient of the loss with respect to logits:
   - If we denote by $$ L$$ our loss function, then for each class $$ j$$:
   - The gradient with respect to logits is given by:
   - For correct class (where $$ y_j = 1$$):
   - 
$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_j} = p_j - y_j
$$

2. **Gradients for Hidden Layers**:
   - Use the chain rule to propagate gradients back through each layer.
   - For hidden layer outputs, we compute gradients as follows:
   - For hidden layer $$ k$$:
   
$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial a_k} = W_{k+1}^T * (\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_{k+1}}) * f'(z_k)
$$
where $$ f'(\cdot)$$ is the derivative of the activation function (ReLU in this case).

3. **Update Weights**:
   - After computing gradients for all weights, update them using gradient descent:
   
$$
W_k = W_k - lr * (\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_k})
$$
where $$ lr$$ is the learning rate.

### Conclusion

In summary, the mathematics behind training an MLP involves linear transformations through weight matrices, activation functions introducing non-linearity, loss functions quantifying prediction errors, and backpropagation algorithms calculating gradients for efficient weight updates. This mathematical framework underpins how neural networks learn from data and improve their performance over time.
